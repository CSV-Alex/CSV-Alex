## HeWo!!! ðŸ‘‹

When John was pondering 
which language to wield for his new project
he asked his favorite language
out of all the programming languages
who would win them or you
then C++ replied 
well if they were to realize how to better control 
their memory management
it might cause me a bit of trouble
but would you lose?
Nah, I'd Win

When C++ was on its way to the top.
Rust, the world most powerful language
and c++ only worthy opponent
then Rust asked him
"are you the strongest because you're C++?"
"or are you C++ because you are the strongest?"
then C++ replied:
"when it comes to memory management and time. 
My coding skills are truly sublime, because throughout the globe and the internet
I alone am the fastest one.
